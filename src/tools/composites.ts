/**
 * Composite catalogue tools — list, get, create, update and archive / unarchive
 * the bundles that are grouped under one tag and billed as a single thing.
 *
 * These live outside `catalogue.ts` because a composite's inputs don't fit
 * that factory: it takes the wrapped items as three id lists rather than one
 * nested object, and an update that changes one of those lists has to read
 * the other two back first (the API replaces the item set whole). There is no
 * delete on the public API — a composite is retired by archiving it.
 *
 * The money boundary an agent has to understand: creating a composite prices
 * it but charges nobody. An invoice is built from plan components, never from
 * a catalogue entry, so a composite only starts costing money when a plan
 * SELLS it. That second step is `clocknext_create_plan` with a
 * `PRICING_METRIC` component — the wire still uses the old name for it.
