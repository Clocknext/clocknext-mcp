# Metering the codebase

## SDK vs API (decide first, by inspecting the codebase)
- **JS / TS codebase → `@clocknext/sdk`** — typed, with buffering, retries, and idempotency
  built in.
- **Any other language → the REST API** — one route per meter:
  `POST /api/v1/signal/credit`, `/signal/outcome`, `/signal/wallet` for token-priced
  signals, `POST /api/v1/signal/unit` for unit events, and
  `POST /api/v1/signal/composite/complete` to close a composite. The meter is the PATH,
  not a `type` field in the body. (`POST /api/v1/usage` and `POST /api/v1/units` are the
  deprecated predecessors — every response from them carries `Deprecation: true`.)
Ground the exact call shapes in the docs first: call `clocknext_search_docs`, then
`clocknext_get_doc` for the matching result. Every endpoint page has a Node.js SDK example
(use it for JS/TS) and a cURL example (use it for any other language).

## The metering recipe — WRITE THIS, don't hand-roll a wrapper

Credit, outcome, and wallet signals use the async buffered integration below. Unit signals
are different: `signals.unit()` sends immediately and returns a Promise, so handle its
rejection at the product's server boundary. Do not pretend Unit events are buffered. Do NOT
invent a `mode:"sync"` + `try/catch` wrapper for buffered signals.

### 1. One singleton client — **async mode + `onError`**
Async is the default: fire-and-forget, non-blocking, retried, and it routes failures to
`onError` — **never to the caller**. So there is nothing to `try/catch`, and no blocking hop.

```ts
// clocknext.ts
import { ClockNext } from "@clocknext/sdk";
declare const logger: { warn: (context: unknown, message: string) => void };
let client: ClockNext | undefined;
export const meteringEnabled = Boolean(process.env.CLOCKNEXT_API_KEY);
export function clocknext(): ClockNext | undefined {
  if (!meteringEnabled) return undefined;
  client ??= new ClockNext({
    apiKey: process.env.CLOCKNEXT_API_KEY!,
    onError: (err, signal) => logger.warn({ err, type: signal?.type }, "clocknext metering failed"),
  });
  return client;
}
export const shutdownMetering = () => client?.close().catch(() => {}); // call on SIGTERM
```

### 2. Thin, domain-named helpers — one per meter, agentKeys as constants
No `await`-blocking, no `try/catch`. Address each meter by the **exact agentKey** (see the
agentKey rule below). One line each:

```ts
// These keys are placeholders only. Replace them only with the exact entitlement keys
// selected by the user in the mapping state; never copy or invent them.
type TokenCounts = { input: number; output: number; cache?: number };
export const meterChat  = (customerId: string, model: string, t: TokenCounts, agentKey: string, idempotencyKey: string) => clocknext()?.signals.credit({ customerId, model, agentKey, tokens: t, idempotencyKey });
export const meterStep  = (customerId: string, model: string, t: TokenCounts, runId: string, agentKey: string, idempotencyKey: string, complete = false) => clocknext()?.signals.outcome({ customerId, model, agentKey, tokens: t, runId, complete, idempotencyKey }); // outcome = the STEP key; runId groups one run; complete:true on the LAST step bills it
export const meterWallet= (customerId: string, model: string, t: TokenCounts, idempotencyKey: string) => clocknext()?.signals.wallet({ customerId, model, tokens: t, idempotencyKey }); // USD at cost, no margin
export const meterSeat  = async (customerId: string, agentKey: string) => {
  await clocknext()?.signals.unit({ customerId, agentKey });
}; // one immediate event, no tokens; catch/log at the product's server boundary
```

Call them on the **server**, at the billable boundary, **after** the work succeeds.

### 2b. If a composite is in play — tag every signal, then CLOSE it
A composite bills per completed occurrence, so tagging alone charges nothing. Pass the same
`composite` to every signal of one occurrence, and close it where the workflow ends:

```ts
const composite = { ref: "voice_ai", value: callId };   // callId = YOUR id for this occurrence
await clocknext()?.signals.credit({ customerId, model, agentKey, tokens: t, composite });
await clocknext()?.signals.unit({ customerId, agentKey: "minutes", quantity: 4, composite });
await clocknext()?.signals.completeComposite({ customerId, composite }); // ← this bills it
```

The close is a **declaration** — never inferred from which signals arrived — so it belongs on
the line before the workflow's own `return`. An OUTCOME is the exception: its `complete: true`
closes its run and the occurrence together. Details: `references/composite.md`.

### 3. When (and only when) to deviate
- **Gate a request on balance** (reject when out of allowance) → that call uses
  `{ wait: true }` and catches the typed `AllowanceError`. Do NOT gate on `res.usageLog`:
  ingestion is durable, so the server normally answers `202` and `usageLog` is `null` —
  `res.queued` tells you which answer you got. To read a balance directly, use
  `cnk.customers.balances(id)`. This is the ONLY reason to block on a send.
- **At-least-once** (queues/your own retries) → pass your own stable `idempotencyKey`.
  The key must identify the logical billable event (for example, a durable request or job
  id), not a fresh attempt number. Reuse the same key on every retry so an application retry
  cannot create a second charge; do not rely only on a newly generated SDK key when the
  application can replay the same logical event.

## Getting the key into `.env` (the key never enters your context)
The recipe above reads `process.env.CLOCKNEXT_API_KEY` at runtime — you never need the
literal key to write the code. To get it into the project, offer the usual choice:
- **Manually in the Clocknext** — the user copies the same `cnk_…` key they configured for this MCP server
  into the project's `.env`.
- **Set it up using AI** — `clocknext_write_env { envFilePath }`: the server copies the
  key from its own environment into the file server-side and returns only `ok` — the key
  never appears in the conversation. It only accepts files named `.env`, `.env.local`, or
  `.env.development[.local]`, and refuses when the file is git-tracked or not gitignored
  (fix `.gitignore`, then retry).

Either way: add a `CLOCKNEXT_API_KEY=` **placeholder** to `.env.example` (never a real key),
confirm `.env` is gitignored during the separate environment-file preparation state, and
never ask the user to paste the key into the chat.

## The agentKey rule (human-in-the-loop — do NOT get this wrong)
Every credit/outcome signal carries an `agentKey` that must **exactly match** a created
entitlement. The mapping is the user's decision, never yours:
1. Pull the real keys: `clocknext_list_credits`, `clocknext_list_outcomes` (each **step** has
   its own key), `clocknext_list_units`.
2. For **every** call site you're about to meter, show the candidate entitlements **by name**
   and **ask, in plain words, which one this call should charge against** — **one
   call site per question, one turn each (cadence)**, never a batched mapping table. The
   `agentKey` is what you wire internally, not what you ask the user for.
3. **Never invent, guess, or reuse a key without an explicit pick.** A wrong key silently
   meters against the wrong entitlement and corrupts billing.

## Units are not LLM calls
Meter units where the *event* happens in the customer's product — `signals.unit({ agentKey })`
(SDK) or `POST /api/v1/signal/unit` (REST). One call = one unit unless you pass `quantity`:
no tokens, no model. This is the
product's runtime job, **not** the MCP's — the MCP only builds the catalogue.

## Safety
- Keep the `cnk_` key **server-side** (env / secret store) — never client-side, never committed.
- Meter on the **billable boundary** (the real model/API call), not on UI events.
- Send signals from the **server**, after the work succeeds.
- Wire `shutdownMetering()` into graceful shutdown so buffered signals aren't lost on deploy.
