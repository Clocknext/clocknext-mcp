# Pricing & models

## Enabling models — Manually in the Clocknext or Set it up using AI
A model can be enabled either way, and you offer the user the choice (why: it must exist and
be priced before anything downstream can be priced against it):
- **Manually in the Clocknext** → `{base}/settings/models`; tell them which provider + model to enable.
- **Set it up using AI** → `clocknext_add_model` with `provider` + `model` (its catalog id).

Either way:
- Only **catalog** models can be metered. ClockNext auto-prices from its catalog.
- **No catalog price?** The model still enables, but at **$0**, and the tool returns a
  `warning`. Send the user to `{base}/settings/models` to set the price, and **STOP** until
  they confirm it's set — otherwise usage meters at $0.
- **Not in the catalog** (unknown model/provider) → it can't be added or metered at all. Help
  the user pick a supported model; don't offer manual pricing (non-catalog models aren't
  supported).

## How a price is built — the model mixer (credits + outcome steps)
A credit / outcome-step price is **grounded in a model**, never typed by hand. You supply a
**mixer**: one or more enabled models, each with the **avg total tokens** it uses and an
**input / output / cache / cache-write percentage split** (the four total 100; cache-write only
on a model that has a cache-write price). The base cost is those
tokens priced at the model's live per-1M-token rates, summed; then margin:

    basePrice       = Σ  avgTokens × (inputPct·inputPrice + outputPct·outputPrice
                                     + cachePct·cachePrice + cacheWritePct·cacheWritePrice) / 1e6
    pricePerCredit  = basePrice × (1 + marginPercent / 100)
    pricePerOutcome = (Σ step basePrices) × (1 + marginPercent / 100)

Both ways the user can choose compute this for them — neither lets a raw price be typed:
- **Set it up using AI** — `create_credit` takes
  `models: [{ model, avgTokens, inputPct, outputPct, cachePct, cacheWritePct }]` + `marginPercent`;
  `create_outcome` takes the same mixer **per step**. The tool reads live prices via
  `list_models`, computes the base + price, and **rejects a turned-off / unknown model or a
  split that isn't 100** — so an MCP-made entitlement is always model-grounded.
- **Manually in the Clocknext** — the calculator does the same with a **live preview**, and
  additionally **stores the full per-model bundle** on the entitlement.

## Choosing how to set up pricing
Both ground the *number* in live model rates, so both are correct. The difference to explain:
only **Manually in the Clocknext** records the model bundle on the entitlement — the MCP can't,
because the bundle is keyed by an internal model id the public API doesn't expose, so the MCP
stores just the final computed price. That bundle is what makes later **re-pricing and
auditing** easy. So when the user is deciding, **recommend Manually in the Clocknext for
credits/outcomes and say that reason out loud** — but if they'd rather **Set it up using AI**, that's a
valid, fully model-grounded result; do it cleanly and note the one tradeoff (no stored
bundle). Don't keep pushing the ClockNext product after they've chosen.
