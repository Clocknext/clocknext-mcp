/**
 * Operate-mode catalogue tools — CRUD (create / read / update / archive) over the
 * /api/v1 catalogue resources: plans, credits, outcomes, units. These MUTATE the
 * organisation's billing configuration, so they go through the MCP's own API
 * client (`src/api.ts`) rather than letting a model assemble raw API calls.
 *
 * Credit / outcome PRICING is model-grounded: the tool takes a `models` mixer
 * (enabled catalog model + avg tokens + input/output/cache/cache-write split),
 * checks it against the org's live models via list_models, and sends it as the
 * credit's / step's `modelBundle`. The SERVER works the base price out from that
 * bundle (and refuses a credit or new step without one) — an agent can never
 * hand-type an ungrounded price here. (The ClockNext product's mixer is still
 * the preferred, first-class way to price — it previews live; these tools are
 * the fallback and save the same bundle.)
 *
 * Every update tool is a PARTIAL update, like the API behind it: send the id
 * plus only the fields to change; everything left out keeps its stored value.
 *
 * "Archive" maps to `setActive(id, false)` — a reversible deactivation, NOT a hard
 * delete (hard delete exists on the API but is intentionally not exposed here).
