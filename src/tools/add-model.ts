/**
 * clocknext_add_model — enable a model for the org, autopriced from the catalog.
 *
 * MCP-internal on purpose: `POST /api/v1/models` is not in the public SDK or
 * docs. It goes through the MCP's own API client (`src/api.ts`), which uses the
 * org's `cnk_` key and `CLOCKNEXT_BASE_URL` (default production).
 *
 * Only catalog models are supported. AUTO copies the catalog's prices; when the
 * catalog has no price for a model it is still enabled, but at $0 — the tool
 * then tells the caller to set the price on the Models page (it reads the price
 * back to detect this).
